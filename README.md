## Website

This is the codebase for my [bigsky.gg](bigsky.gg) website.  This project was bootstrapped using next-js.  

This website is organized into three main sections.  

1. Arcade.  The arcade hosts on-chain games.  The primary goal of the arcade is to create an intuitive interactive playground for understanding the future of on-chain gaming. I want the Arcade to eventually host three core components.  An arcade for playing on-chain games, a shop where players can buy skins etc, and a DEX for efficiently converting between currencies.  

2. Writing.  This section provides a clear and easy to understand place for me to compile my writing and reading.  I would like the reference section to eventually become a sort of digital library where I can easily archive different articles I am reading.  

3. Death Machine.  This section details the design and structure of the Death Virtual Machine.  This virtual machine aims to be a fully functional zk-vm designed specifically for the efficient execution of on-chain games.  

## Getting Started
