=======================================================

The FTX scandal helped me see many industry dynamics.  Most importantly the power of scrolling algorithms came into extremely clear relief. I work in crypto, and have worked in this industry exclusively over the past three years. I write lots of code, and have rebuilt several large smart-contract code bases in different languages.  However, the amount of time I spend actually interacting with the block-chain is dwarfed by the amount of time I spend scrolling and liking.

Following the massive Twitter dopamine binge of the past week, scrolling algorithms clearly have a tremendous amount of power to shape collective behavior and attention.  We all know this.  This fact has been repeated ad-nausea for at least the past 5-years.  However, knowing that something is happening is very different from deep intuitive feeling. During this past week - you could almost feel the Twiter algorithm twisting and reshaping the entire human experience of the week's events.

One area where algorithmically goverened human interaction is especially pronounced is the world of competitive video games.  

Over the past month, I've begun to explore DOTA 2.  Part of my interest comes from a strong desire to design and build block-chain based games.  To build games, you need to play games.  I've also seen that many of the most succesful people in crypto are former high-level video game or online poker players.        

Possibly the most important aspect of modern day esports is the idea of the [Elo Rating System](http://www.glicko.net/research/acjpaper.pdf).  This system assigns each player a score based on past performance. When players with different scores compete the system can then predictthe likely hood of victory for the player with the higher cumulative score.  

Human achievment and performance will continually move closer and closer to ELO type ranking systems.  This will be especially true for our economic lives.  What is crypto if not a massive ELO ranking system where participants are rewarded based on their interactions.  

My biggest takeway from this last week was that while I spent the last three years learning everything about crypto, what I really should have been studying was Twitter.  Scrolling based platforms and matching algorythms dictates our current reality far more than the blockchain.
