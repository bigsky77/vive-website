title: Major Zero Knowledge Papers  
---
===============================================================================================

## Outline

When I started diving into the world of zero-knowledge proof systems, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of academic papers.  Even for people with a signifigant academic background in mathmatics, exposure to high-level and cutting edge theoretical research is a major challenge.  Theoretical computer sceince, of the type we are studing,  operates at a level of abstraction unlike anything else.  However, the foundation is solid, and even highly theoretical and abstract concepts are ultimatly applied to real systems.  

Proofs are used by mathmaticians to translate abstract ideas to mathmatical fact.  Within pure mathematics ZKPs fall under a broader catagory of Interactive Proof systems. These systems are built on interactions between a 'prover' and a 'verifier'.  Randomness often plays a key role in these proofs.   

[The Knowledge Complexity Of Interactive Proof Systems](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf) is widely considered first major paper to specifically outline a zero-knowledge protocol.
