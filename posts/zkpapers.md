title: Major Zero Knowledge Papers  
---
===============================================================================================
When I started diving into the world of zero-knowledge proof systems, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of academic papers.  Even for people with a signifigant academic background in mathmatics, exposure to high-level and cutting edge theoretical research is a major challenge.  Theoretical computer sceince, of the type we are studing,  operates at a level of abstraction unlike anything else.  However, the foundation is solid, and even highly theoretical and abstract concepts are ultimatly applied to human reality.  The most important step are formal proofs.  These proofs are the foundation of the discipline.
